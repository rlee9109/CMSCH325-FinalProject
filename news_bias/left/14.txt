"Real Time host Bill Maher on Friday criticized the Democratic Party for its failure to make gains in the 2020 elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate.

Maher suggested Democrats were too concerned about issues like political correctness, a topic he's covered before, and they'd put off too many voters by being ""woke.""

While the party will keep control of the House and Speaker Nancy Pelosi is almost certain to be re-elected, their majority has been unexpectedly reduced. Two runoff elections in Georgia in January will decide control of the Senate, but Democrats appear unlikely to prevail.

During the show's ""New Rules"" segment, Maher said that the message the country had given Democrats was: ""We don't like Trump, but we still can't bring ourselves to vote for you.""

""Liberals can either write off half the country as irredeemable or they can ask, 'What is is about a 'D' next to a candidate's name that makes it so toxic?'"" he said.

Maher pointed to newly re-elected Democratic Representative Conor Lamb (PA-17), who has said his party ""needs to be dialed back. It needs to be rooted in common sense."" As Maher showed, former President Barack Obama has made a similar point.


""There, in my opinion is the crux of the problem,"" the HBO host said. ""Democrats too often don't come off as having common sense to a huge swath Americans. Democrats are the party of every hypersensitive social justice warrior woke bullshit story in the news.""

Maher listed some recent news items he said were examples of this hypersensitivity, including criticism of actor Anne Hathaway for playing a witch with three fingers. Critics charged the portrayal was insensitive to people with limb difference."
