"White House Adviser Jared Kushner Discussed Possible Concession with Trump: Report

Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and one of his most trusted advisers, has reportedly approached Donald Trump to discuss his conceding to President-elect Joe Biden, according to CNN, which cited two anonymous sources.

The Democrat has been deemed the victor with calls having seen him cross the threshold for an Electoral College vote majority, though Trump intends to pursue legal challenges over the counting of ballots as he persists he has been truly victorious.

Late Saturday evening, CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins told her 722,000 Twitter followers: ""Some news â€” Jared Kushner has approached President Trump about conceding the election"" based on two anonymous sources. CNN.com included the report in its Live Updates blog 10 hours later, on Sunday morning.


Newsweek, which could not independently verify the discussions, has contacted the Trump campaign for comment upon the Kushner reports.

Collins has previously reported that discussions were being had in the White House over who should ""bring the president to terms with reality,"" suggesting Kushner as well as Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and also an adviser, were being considered as the person to do so.

Trump has yet to concede to Biden despite world leaders and even several high-profile Republicans moving to congratulate the Democrat."
