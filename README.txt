News Classifier Program

This program takes in news article data sorted by tone or media bias and builds a Naive Bayes Classifier model to categorize the articles.

The program takes in 1 argument from the command line. If you would like to classify the news articles by tone, type in news_tone as the first argument, referring to the folder holding the articles sorted by tone. If you would like to classify the articles based on media bias, type in news_bias.

The classifier program outputs the accuracy score for 1 run as well as the 15 most informative features of the model. Please see code for more detailed comments about the model.
